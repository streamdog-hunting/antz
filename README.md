This monorepo contains a modular, cross-platform framework for working with ANT+ protocols. 
While a primary use case is bridging Garmin trackers (such as Astro and Alpha series devices) to BLE, 
the project is designed to support a wider range of applications including simulation, desktop tooling, 
and data forwarding. It provides a portable decoding engine and platform-specific adapters for receiving 
ANT+ messages and connecting them to various outputs, including BLE, GATT, and cloud services.

## ✨ Features

* Decode **Asset Tracker** and **HRM** ANT+ profiles
* Receive ANT+ data from Garmin **Astro** (legacy, ANT+ only) and **Alpha** (ANT+/BLE) devices

## 🚧 Roadmap

* Bridge tracker data to BLE GATT for mobile integration
* Reusable across nRF52 embedded systems, Linux/macOS tools, and test environments
* Modular simulation support for test-driven development
* BLE simulation (e.g., mimicking Alpha X in Garmin Explore)

## ✅ Current Platform Focus

* Embedded BLE dongle using **nRF52840** (e.g., Seeed Studio XIAO)
* Built with **nRF5 SDK v17.1.0** and **SoftDevice S340**
* Desktop support for **Linux/macOS** using **DSIFramerANT** (ANT USB stick)
* Optional future Zephyr/NCS-based support via Garmin's ANT stack
* Embedded BLE dongle using **nRF52840** (e.g., Seeed Studio XIAO)
* Built with **nRF5 SDK v17.1.0** and **SoftDevice S340**
* ANT+ support based on Nordic + Garmin profile specifications

## 🛠 Development

After first checkout you need to configure build with `cmake` for
the platform you are developing code for. If you are developing for
Mac, you should run the following command from the root of the repo;

```bash
cmake -B build/darwin -S . -DANTZ_PLATFORM=darwin
```

You can compile ANT SDK for this platform with:

```bash
cmake --build build/darwin --target full_sdk_build
```

which builds binaries to `sdks/ANT-SDK_Mac.3.5/Bin`

## 📦 Installing on Raspberry Pi 4

### Quick install from GitHub Releases
The easiest way to install on RPI4 is to download the latest pre-built package:

```bash
# Download latest release (replace VERSION with actual version, e.g., v0.1.0)
VERSION=v0.1.0
wget https://github.com/kengu/antz/releases/download/${VERSION}/antz-0.1.0-Linux.deb

# Install the package
sudo dpkg -i antz-0.1.0-Linux.deb

# If missing dependencies, fix them with:
sudo apt-get install -f

# Before you start the service, make sure you have a USB ANT+ stick connected.
# If you want to use MQTT, make sure you have a broker running and edit the 
# line `ExecStart=/usr/bin/antz` in the service file located at 
# `/lib/systemd/system/antz.service` to match your needs.
# For help on arguments, run `sudo /usr/bin/antz -h`

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable antz
sudo systemctl start antz

# Check status and logs
sudo systemctl status antz
sudo journalctl -u antz -f
```

The package automatically installs:
- Binary at `/usr/bin/antz`
- Systemd service at `/lib/systemd/system/antz.service`
- udev rules at `/lib/udev/rules.d/99-antz.rules` (for ANT+ USB access)

### Building from source on RPI4
If you want to build the package yourself:

```bash
# First time setup: install all dependencies
./scripts/configure-rpi4.sh

# Build the package
./scripts/build-rpi4.sh

# Install and run
sudo dpkg -i build-rpi4/antz-*.deb
sudo systemctl enable antz
sudo systemctl start antz
```

### For developers: Creating releases
Packages are automatically built via GitHub Actions when you push a git tag:
```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The workflow runs on self-hosted RPI4 runners and publishes the `.deb` to GitHub Releases.

## Apps 
Each antz app is a concrete use case that uses antz to implement it. 
They can be implemented for a concrete platform or support multiple 
platforms. It all depends on the use case described in the README for 
each of them.

### ant_discovery (legacy)
To support the migration to the new modular structure, the legacy implementation under 
[apps/ant_discovery](apps/ant_discovery/README.md) is temporarily preserved and included as a standalone build target. 
This allows side-by-side builds and comparison during refactoring. If you wish to include it 
in the build, the top-level [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) contains:

```cmake
option(ANTZ_DISCOVERY "Include ant_discovery module" ON)
```

This keeps compatibility while new modules are migrated incrementally. You can use ANT SDK binaries for this platform with:

```bash
cmake --build build/darwin --target ant_discovery
```

If you have an ANT+ USB dongle connected to your development machine, run 
```bash
sh ./ant_discovery/bin/ant_discovery
```
to start discovery of HRM and Asset Tracker devices near you. 

## 🐾 Use Case

**Antz** is especially relevant for Nordic hunting communities, where older **Garmin Astro + DC 50** collars are still in use and **cannot communicate via BLE**. This project bridges that gap:

* Adds mobile and cloud support to Astro-series devices
* Extends the life and utility of legacy Garmin tracking gear
* Enables mixed Astro + Alpha setups from one phone
