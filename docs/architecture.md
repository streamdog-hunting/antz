# Architecture Overview: antz – ANT+ Tooling Framework

This document outlines the architectural foundation of the `antz` project — 
a modular, cross-platform framework for working with ANT+ protocols across multiple 
use cases. While a primary application is an ANT+ to BLE bridge for Garmin Astro and 
Alpha dog trackers, the project is designed to support broader functionality such as 
simulation, desktop analysis, and cloud integration. It is located in the `docs/` 
folder of the repository.

## Project Goal

Design and implement a flexible, cross-platform ANT+ processing toolkit that can be 
adapted to a variety of environments:

* Run as a BLE-capable firmware for dongles (e.g., nRF52) to forward Garmin tracker data to smartphones
* Operate as a desktop or daemonized ANT+ listener (e.g., Linux/Darwin with USB stick)
* Optionally connect to the internet to relay ANT+ data to a cloud backend
* Simulate BLE Alpha X devices to make older Astro collars appear in Garmin Explore
* Support ANT+ profile decoding (HRM, Asset Tracker) in a testable, modular, platform-independent way

## Design Requirements

* Must support **ANT+** reception for Garmin **Asset Tracker** and **HRM** profiles
* Must support **BLE Peripheral** mode (where applicable) to expose decoded data
* Must run on **nRF52 hardware**, **Linux**, and **Darwin**, using appropriate SDKs
* Must enable reuse of **decoding logic** across targets via a clean, portable C++ core

```

Each module plays a distinct role:

* `libs/core/` handles ANT+ profile parsing in a testable, portable way
* `libs/bridge/` connects parsed device data to outputs like BLE or file logs
* `libs/platform/` handles ANT channel setup, packet transport, and SDK interop
* `apps/` provide full builds for firmware, test tools, and simulators
* `sdks/` stores patched external SDKs or local build support
* `docs/` contains architecture, platform, and usage documentation
